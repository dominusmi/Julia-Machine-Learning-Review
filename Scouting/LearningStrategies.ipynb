    "# Learning Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "_git:_ https://github.com/JuliaML/LearningStrategies.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the JuliaML _Learn.jl_ and _LearningStrategies.jl_, the Julia team built a framework allowing the simple implementation of new algorithms and learning strategies through the structure, and therefore also making it extremely simple to combine multiple strategies together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy here simply means a way for the user to tell how a model (stored as a _struct_) is setup, trained and updated. This idea stems from the very similar property most learning algorithms operate with, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Learning a model involves a model, a strategy and (not necessary) some data    \n",
    "function learn!(model, strat::LearningStrategy, data)   \n",
    "    # We set up the model, can be preparing arrays for training, doing some preprocessing\n",
    "    setup!(strat, model[, data])           \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Using the \"repeated\" function  on your data allows it to replicate it infinitely\n",
    "    for (i, item) in enumerate(data)                    \n",
    "    \n",
    "        # Update the model according to the strategy(-ies) and the data  \n",
    "        update!(model, strat[, i], item) \n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Allows to record information or generally \"hook in\" the process. Should NOT modify in place\n",
    "        hook(strat, model[, data], i)    \n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Checks if the finishing condition has been reached\n",
    "        finished(strat, model[, data], i) && break      \n",
    "    end\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Clean up after yourself\n",
    "    cleanup!(strat, model) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return the trained model\n",
    "    model                                               \n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be translated as setup, iterate over data until some end condition is met, and clean up.\n",
    "In addition, a conventional extra function which can (and should) be defined if your model is predictive, is _predict()_, which should be imported from StatsBase. The pseudocode is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function predict(model, data)\n",
    "    # Make predictions\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## LearningStrategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A LearningStrategy is simply a struct which extends _LearningStrategy_. A strategy needs not contain any variable, all that is required is that at least one of the following functions is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setup!(strat, model, data)`\n",
    "- `cleanup!(strat, model)`\n",
    "- `hook(strat, model, i)`\n",
    "- `finished(strat, model, data, i)`\n",
    "- `update!(model, strat, item)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind of course that if only the `hook` function is defined for a generic strategy _StrategyA_, and this is the only strategy given for learning, the model will.. not learn anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture makes it extremely simple for user wanting to write his own learning algorithm to add methods as they come without need further planning. For instance, suppose one strats off by just implementing and `SGD()` optimizer, then all that would be required is to define the structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "struct SGD() <:LearningStrategy end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then implement the actual optimization by defining a function `update!(model, strategy::SGD)`. Later on, if the same user or another wants to implement _AdaProx_ optimizer, they can simply add a new function `update!(model, strategy::AdaProx)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not even required to explicitely wirte a `learn!` function if all you need is the `update!`, simply use the call\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "learn!(model, SGD(), data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and Julia will handle the \"missing\" functions (by simply skipping them) and will make the call to the update you defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the _data_ (and _i_)parameter is not actually required, all the base functions are defined with both data and no data argument\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meta-Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "One extremely powerful feature that this framework offers is the combination of strategies. For instance, while only one strategy will tell the model how to train and update for each iteration, extra strategies which only give side indications can be very easily used. For instance, one of the built-in strategies is `MaxIter(n=100)` which, if given in conjuction to a laerning strategy for any model, will overload the _finished_ function, and will do its own check as to whether the algorithm is indeed over. A simple use would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "learn!(MyModel(), strategies( MyLearningStrategy(), MaxIter(20) ), MyData )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the learning process will end after 20 iterations, even if the conditions for _finished()_ given by the _MyLearningStrategy_ are not met (only one _finished_ condition needs to be met for the learning to stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you develop your own learning model, you do not need to also add all this \"side functionalities\"! How great is that!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Different algorithms use data differently. Some iterate over each element, while other take batches and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The base code uses this loop: `for (i, item) in enumerate(data)`. This implies the data supplied for training is an iterable. This is often not really the case, for instance a matrix, although technically iterable, will be enumerated by element, instead of by row or column which is the more natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two solutions are therefore proposed;\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is to pass a _repeated_ matrix using Base.Iterators.repeated, which will basically make every \"item\" a copy of the initial matrix. This is simply used as `repeated(matrix)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other is to do some preprocessing, possibly using the `setup!` function or in some other way. It would be, for example, possible to make a row iterator, in the case of a row-majored matrix."
