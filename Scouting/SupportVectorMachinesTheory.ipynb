    "In the mathematical formulation we see that SVMs traditionally separate binary classes. To apply these methods to a multiclass problem we need to adapt further algorithms. We will present two basic approaches here. For further reading I recommend http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319022994-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1446422-p175468473. \n",

Given a test problem, each classifer is applied to it and the winning class is labelled. After all classifiers where applied, the class that got most labels is returned as output. Even though many classifiers are initialised the size of the Quadratic Programming problem is relatively small, therefore the training can be done fast. \n",

    "In this approach, for n different classes n different binary classifers are constructed. For classes $i=1,...,n$ the $ith$ classifier uses the elements of class $i$ as positive training examples and the remaining classes as negative training examples. While testing the class label is then determined by the classifier that returns the maximum output value. A disadvantage of this method is the forced skewedness of the training data. If the original problem is symmetric, meaning it has the same amount of instances in every class, the constructed subproblems will have $1/n$ examples in one class and $n-1/n$ examples in the other. This breaks the symmetry of the original problem.\n"
