    "This library is a utility library used to transform targets which can come in an array of ways (booleans, $(-1,1)$, continuous variables) into specific labels. This is very important in many classification problems, since for instance NNs expect vectors of the form $[1,0,0]$ for three classes, while SVMs expect scalars in the set ${-1,1}$.\n",
