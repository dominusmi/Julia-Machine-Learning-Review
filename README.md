# Julia Statistics and Machine Learning Library Compilation
## University of Warwick Research Group

In this repository, we aim to provide the Julia community with a simple way of finding the best up to date packages for multiple types of statical and machine learning models.

We are currently scouting the community to gather the best packages, and writing explanatory notebooks providind a mathematical background for the various methods, and then link them to packages-notebooks to help users get started.

_This project is part of the MSc course Mathematics for Real-World Systems of the University of Warwick._
